## Quick Start

### 2. Extract

Extract the entire folder to your desired location.

### 3. Configure

Rename `settings.ini.example` to `settings.ini` and edit the settings you want to enable/disable.

### 4. Run

Double-click `AutoAFK.exe`

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Android emulator or device with ADB enabled
- ADB is included in the release package
- No Python required (fully compiled)

## How do I run it?
Configure your Android emulator so that:
* ADB is enabled
* Resolution is 1920x1080
* DPI is 240
* AFK's language is set to English

## Linux Setup (run from source)

> AutoAFK on Linux runs from source only. PyInstaller builds, the auto-updater,
> and emulator-specific integrations are not provided in this release.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 – 3.12 (`python3 --version`)
- `android-tools` package providing `adb`. On CachyOS / Arch:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S android-tools
  ```
  On Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt install android-tools-adb`.
  On Fedora: `sudo dnf install android-tools`.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hammanek/AutoAFK.git
cd AutoAFK
chmod +x install.sh start.sh   # only needed if the executable bit was lost
./install.sh
```

### Run

```bash
./start.sh
# or, equivalently:
python3 main.py
# headless modes (same flags as Windows):
python3 main.py --dailies
python3 main.py --autotower
python3 main.py --tower kt
```

### Display configuration

The recommended emulator/device display is **1920x1080 at DPI 240**.
Other configurations may work with reduced image-recognition accuracy;
AutoAFK will log a warning at startup if it detects a non-recommended
configuration but will not block startup.

### Choosing an emulator on Linux

| Emulator | Setup guide | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Genymotion** | [`GENYMOTION_SETUP.md`](GENYMOTION_SETUP.md) | Recommended. VirtualBox-based, official ADB support, ARM-translation built in. Free Personal Edition. |
| **Waydroid** | [`WAYDROID_SETUP.md`](WAYDROID_SETUP.md) | Native Linux container. Lighter than Genymotion but requires firewall + libhoudini setup; more brittle. |

### Updating on Linux

```bash
git pull
./install.sh    # only if requirements.txt changed
```

The in-app auto-updater is Windows-only.

## Configuration

Edit `settings.ini`:

4. Restart the bot automatically

Note: Updater is fully compiled - no Python installation needed!

### Auto-Update

The bot will automatically update and restart when a new version is available.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't start

1. Check if ADB is working: `adb devices`
2. Check if device is connected
3. Check `settings.ini` configuration
4. Check logs in `logs/` folder

### ADB not found

ADB is included in the release package. If you have issues:
1. Make sure `adb.exe` and `AdbWinApi.dll` are in the same folder as `AutoAFK.exe`
2. Try restarting the emulator
3. Check if Windows Defender is blocking ADB

### Device not found

1. Run `adb devices` in command prompt to see connected devices
2. Make sure USB debugging is enabled (for physical devices)
3. Make sure ADB is enabled in emulator settings
4. Try restarting ADB: `adb kill-server` then `adb start-server`
5. If using emulator, set correct port in `settings.ini` under `[ADVANCED]` section:
   ```ini
   port = 5555  # or your emulator's port
   ```

### Activities not working

1. Check if game is running
2. Check if game is at campaign screen
3. Check image recognition settings
4. Check debug screenshots in `debug/` folder

### Update failed

1. Download manually from [Releases](https://github.com/Hammanek/AutoAFK/releases/latest)
2. Extract and replace all files except `settings.ini`
3. Run `AutoAFK.exe`

Note: Updater is fully compiled, no Python needed!
